"""Why does the retrieved passage not cover the question?

The v6 conformance run put the bottleneck beyond doubt: 23 questions, **1**
contract failure and **9** gate refusals, six of them
`passage_does_not_cover_question`. Generation is not the problem. And in five of
those six the cited chapter was the *expected* chapter — so retrieval found the
right chapter and the wrong concept-unit inside it.

That leaves two hypotheses, and both are answerable with no LLM call at all:

  H1  the covering chunk exists but ranks below CONTEXT_CHUNKS (=3), so the
      generator never sees it
  H2  the covering chunk IS in context but CONTEXT_CHARS (=900) truncates it
      before the part that answers the question

This prints, for each question, every Class 5 chunk in the expected chapter with
its score and rank, marks which three reach the generator, and flags any chunk
the 900-character window would cut. Judgement about which chunk *covers* the
question is left to a human reading the output — inferring it from the score
would assume the very thing under test.

Costs nothing to run: retrieval is local, and the Groq daily budget is not
touched.
